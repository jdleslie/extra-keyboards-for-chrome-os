# Ignore Modifiers

Selectively suppresses handling of modifiers when specific windows are active. Windows are identified by URL. This allows modifiers like <kbd>Search</kbd> and <kbd>Assistant</kbd> to pass through as normal keyboard events to the active application, which is useful for remote control applications (e.g. Citrix Receiver & Workspace).

Non-keyboard events (e.g. touchpad gestures, mouse, etc.) are unaffected.
